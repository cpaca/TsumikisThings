Tsumiki's Things is a mod that does things that Tsumiki wants.

Current features:
Super-modifiers. When you reforge at tinkerer, you have a chance of getting at least one extra effect. 
Super-modifiers get weaker at seven times the cap (so having more than 21% extra damage from super mods wouldn't be as effective.)
It never *stops* being effective, though.
